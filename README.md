# About me

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Systems at EPITA, with a strong academic foundation in AI, data science, and business transformation. My academic path also includes a dual Master‚Äôs program from SKEMA Business School and ESIEA, and a Bachelor's degree from the University of Bristol. During my high school and university years, I deepened my understanding of mathematics and statistics through courses such as Further Mathematics, Additional Mathematics, and STEP Mathematics within the A-Level system.

My expertise lies in designing and deploying end-to-end data solutions, integrating machine learning models, and transforming complex data into actionable insights. I am proficient in Python and SQL, which I use extensively for data manipulation, analysis, and automation. I also have solid experience in creating compelling data visualizations and dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, and InDesign, allowing me to effectively communicate insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I have hands-on experience building real-time dashboards with Grafana, developing predictive analytics pipelines, and deploying scalable applications using Docker, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.

Professionally, I specialize in data cleaning, visualization, and business analysis aimed at driving operational efficiency and business growth. I am currently seeking a six-month internship as a Data Analyst, where I can continue to strengthen my skills in data processing, data mining, and data visualization.
