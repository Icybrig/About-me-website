# About me

I am a student in EPITA's master program in Artificial Intelligence System with a solid foundation in artificial intelligence, data science, and business transformation. My academic journey includes a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Systems from EPITA and a dual Master's from Skema Business School and ESIEA, equipping me with advanced technical and analytical skills. Also, I took Bachlor in University of Bristol with filming field which made me have strong abilities in filming technologies such as OBS Studio, Adobe Indesign. During the university and high school, I also participated the lessons for mathematics and statistics, such as Further math, Additional math and Step math in A-Level system.

Currently, I specialize in designing and deploying data solutions, integrating machine learning, and delivering actionable insights through innovative tools. My projects include building real-time dashboards using Grafana, developing predictive models, and deploying applications leveraging Docker, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, which those projects you could find below. My professional experience spans data cleaning, visualization, and business analysis to drive growth and operational optimization.
